well folks my mac plus finally gave up the ghost this weekend after starting life as a 512k way back in 1985  sooo im in the market for a new machine a bit sooner than i intended to be  im looking into picking up a powerbook 160 or maybe 180 and have a bunch of questions that hopefully somebody can answer   does anybody know any dirt on when the next round of powerbook introductions are expected  id heard the 185c was supposed to make an appearence this summer but havent heard anymore on it  and since i dont have access to macleak i was wondering if anybody out there had more info   has anybody heard rumors about price drops to the powerbook line like the ones the duos just went through recently   whats the impression of the display on the 180  i could probably swing a 180 if i got the 80Mb disk rather than the 120 but i dont really have a feel for how much better the display is yea it looks great in the store but is that all wow or is it really that good  could i solicit some opinions of people who use the 160 and 180 daytoday on if its worth taking the disk size and money hit to get the active display  i realize this is a real subjective question but ive only played around with the machines in a computer store breifly and figured the opinions of somebody who actually uses the machine daily might prove helpful   how well does hellcats perform    thanks a bunch in advance for any info  if you could email ill post a summary news reading time is at a premium with finals just around the corner    Tom Willis    twillisecnpurdueedu        Purdue Electrical Engineering,"{

From article C5owCBn3pworldstdcom by tombakerworldstdcom Tom A Baker   My understanding is that the expected errors are basically known bugs in the warning system software  things are checked that dont have the right values in yet because they arent set till after launch and suchlike Rather than fix the code and possibly introduce new bugs they just tell the crew ok if you see a warning no 213 before liftoff ignore it,"{

Of course  The term must be rigidly defined in any bill   I doubt she uses this term for that  You are using a quote allegedly from her can you back it up     I read the article as presenting first an argument about weapons of mass destruction as commonly understood and then switching to other topics The first point evidently was to show that not all weapons should be allowed and then the later analysis was given this understanding to consider another class,"{

ALL this shows is that YOU dont know much about SCSI  SCSI1 with a SCSI1 controler chip range is indeed 05MBs and that is ALL you have right about SCSI SCSI1 With a SCSI2 controller chip 46MBs with 10MBs burst 8bit  Note the INCREASE in SPEED the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI1  so it DOES exist Some PC use this set up too SCSI2 8bitSCSI1 mode          46MBs with 10MBs burst SCSI2 16bitwide or fast mode  812MBs with 20MBs burst SCSI2 32bitwide AND fast     1520MBs with 40MBs burst   By your OWN data the Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI is correct With a SCSI2 controller chip SCSI1 can reach 10MBs which is indeed 20 faster than IDE 120 of 83 is 996 ALL these SCSI facts have been posted to this newsgroup in my Mac  IBM info sheet available by FTP on  sumexaimstanfordedu 364406 in the infomacreport as  macibmcompareversion txt It should be 173 but 161 may still be there  Part of this problem is both Mac and IBM PC are inconsiant about what SCSI is which  Though it is WELL documented that the Quadra has a SCSI2 chip an Apple salesperson said it uses a fast SCSI1 chip Not at a 6MBs 10MBs burst it does not SCSI1 is 5MBs maximum synchronous and Quadra uses ANsynchronous SCSI which is SLOWER  It seems that Mac and IBM see SCSI1 interface and think SCSI1 when it maybe a SCSI1 interface driven in the machine by a SCSi2 controller chip in 8bit mode Which is MUCH FASTER then true SCSI1 can go,"{

Ive had the board for over a year and it does work with Diskdoubler but not with Autodoubler due to a licensing problem with Stac Technologies the owners of the boards compression technology Im writing this from memory Ive lost the reference Please correct me if Im wrong  Using the board Ive had problems with file icons being lost but its hard to say whether its the boards fault or something else however if I decompress the troubled file and recompress it without the board the icon usually reappears Because of the above mentioned licensing problem the freeware expansion utility DD Expand will not decompress a boardcompressed file unless you have the board installed  Since Stac has its own product now it seems unlikely that the holes in AutodoublerDiskdoubler related to the board will be fixed Which is sad and makes me very reluctant to buy Stacs product since theyre being so stinky But hey thats competition,"{

Yep thats pretty much it Im not a Jew but I understand that this is the Jewish way of thinking However the Jews believe that the Covenant between YHWH and the Patriarchs Abraham and Moses in this case establishes a Moral Code to follow for mankind Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries fall though  As I understand it the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was required whereas the Pharisees the ancestors of modern Judaism believed that the Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of the required Morality in all its nuances Talmud  The essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between Man and YHWH for a Jew or Christian and does not necessarily indicate anything about YHWH outside of that relationship although one can speculate   The trouble with all of this is that we dont really know what the created in His image means Ive heard a number of different opinions on this and have still not come to any conclusion This rather upsets the Apple Cart if one wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation to mix metaphors unashamedly As to living by Christs example we know very little about Jesus as a person We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives by his followers and some very small references from comtemporary historians Revelation aside one can only know Christ secondhand or worse  This is not an attempt to debunk Christianity although it may seem that way initially the point Im trying to make is that we only really have the Bible to interpret and that interpretation is by humanity I guess this is where Faith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness   No There may be an absolute moral code There are undoubtably multiple moral codes The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral code As an example a parent may tell a child never to swear and the child may assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told the child that it is wrong Now the parent may swear like a trooper in the pub or bar where there are no children The wrongness here is if the child disobeys the parent The parent may feel that it is inappropriate to swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of animals The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that he is of the same type as the parent and may be a parent later in life but you get the gist of it Incidentally the young child considers the directive as absolute until he gets older see Piaget and learns a morality of his own  David   On religion,"{

Description of External Tank option for SSF redesign deleted   Yo Ken lets keep ontop of things Both the External Tank and Wingless Orbiter options have been deleted from the SSF redesign options list Todays 423 edition of the New York Times reports that OConnor told the panel that some redesign proposals have been dropped such as using the giant external fuel tanks used in launching space shuttles and building a station around an existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed  Currently there are three options being considered as presented to the advisory panel meeting yesterday and as reported in todays Times  Option A  Low Cost Modular Approach This option is being studied by a team from MSFC As an aside there are SSF redesign teams at MSFC JSC and LaRC supporting the SRT Station Redesign Team in Crystal City Both LeRC and Reston folks are also onsite at these locations helping the respective teams with their redesign activities Key features of this option are     Uses Bus1 a modular bus developed by Lockheed thats      qualified for STS and ELVs The bus provides propulsion GNC      Communications  Data Management Lockheed developed this      for the Air Force     A Power Station Capability is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights      SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power The vehicle      flies in an arrow mode to optimize the microgravity environment      ShuttleSpacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power      source for 30 day missions     Human tended capability as opposed to the old SSF sexist term      of mantended capability is achieved by the addition of the      US Common module This is a modified version of the existing      SSF Lab module docking ports are added for the International      Partners labs taking the place of the nodes on SSF The      Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions      The Orbiter would provide crew habitability  EVA capability     International Human Tended Add the NASDA  ESA modules and      add another 20 kW of power     Permanent Human Presence Capability Add a 3rd power module      the US habitation module and an ACRV Assured Crew Return      Vehicle  Option B  Space Station Freedom Derived The Option B team is based at LaRC and is lead by Mike Griffin This option looks alot like the existing SSF design which we have all come to know and love   This option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for use on all SSF assembly flights so does option A Also the  number of flights is computed for a 516 inclination orbit for both options A and B  The buildup occurs in six phases     Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights Power      is transferred from the vehicle to the OrbiterSpacelab when      it visits     ManTended Capability Griffin has not yet adopted nonsexist      language is achieved after 8 flights The US Lab is      deployed and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power     Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights by      keeping one Orbiter onorbit to use as an ACRV so sometimes      there would be two Orbiters onorbit  the ACRV and the      second one that comes up for Logistics  Resupply     A Two Fault Tolerance Capability is achieved after 14 flights      with the addition of a 2nd power module another thermal      control system radiator and more propulsion modules     After 20 flights the Internationals are onboard More power      the Habitation module and an ACRV are added to finish the      assembly in 24 flights  Most of the systems currently on SSF are used asis in this option  with the exception of the data management system which has major changes,"{

Dont be so sure  Look what happened to Japanese citizens in the US during World War II  If youre prepared to say Lets round these people up and stick them in a concentration camp without trial its only a short step to gassing them without trial  After all it seems that the Nazis originally only intended to imprison the Jews the Final Solution was dreamt up partly because they couldnt afford to run the camps because of the devastation caused by Goerings Total War  Those who werent gassed generally died of malnutrition or disease,"{

I certainly do use it whenever I have to do TIFF and it usually works very well  Thats not my point  Im philosophically opposed to it because of its complexity  This complexity has led to some programs poor TIFF writers making some very bizarre files other programs inability to load TIFF images though theyll save them of course and a general inability to interchange images between different environments despite the fact they all think they understand TIFF  As the saying goes Its not me Im worried about its all the abuse of TIFF over the years and I chalk it all up to the immense and unnecessary complexity of the format  In the words of the TIFF 50 spec Appendix G page G1 capitalized emphasis mine  The only problem with this sort of success is that TIFF was designed to be powerful and flexible at the expense of simplicity  It takes a fair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in this specification PROBABLY NO APPLICATION DOES A COMPLETE JOB and that is currently the only way you can be sure that you will be able to import any TIFF image since there are so many imagegenerating applications out there now   If a program or worse all applications cant read every TIFF image that means there are some it wont some that I might have to deal with  Why would I want my images to be trapped in that format  I dont and neither should anyone who agrees with my reasoning not that anyone does of course,"{

		The forecast calls for Thunder89 TBird SC    Its a hell of a thing killing a man You take away all he has 	and all hes ever gonna have 			Will Munny Unforgiven  61   I am beyond the under 25 age group but I have an experience a few years ago that might be interesting to you  I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica GT  I decided to buy myself a gift  a more exotic car  Front runners included the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 1987 model years I narrowed it down to those two  I liked the simplicity and handling and snob appeal too of driving a Porsche  The Supra Turbo was less money and had more features and performance  almost a personal luxury car  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924 I was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924 but i decided to stop by my insurance agents office on the way  I asked about what would happen to my rate with either car   If you buy the Supra your rate classification will be the same as the Celica the 85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars with a slight increase because the car will be 2 years newer  Our lowerrisk division will continue to handle your account   If you buy the Porsche 924 well have to change you to the standard higher rate company and your rate will double  And if you go with a 944 its another story again  well cover the rest of this year but cancel you after that   But the Supra is much faster than the 924 and the 924 is actually faster than the standard 944  That doenst make sense    Thats what the book says  We dont insure Corvettes either  For some reason the underwriters consider Supras  and their drivers  as very traditional and conservative   I eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons  The Porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested but a tough highpressure guy in the back room  At equal monthly payments it would have taken a year longer to pay for the Porsche plus its higher insurance  I concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto theft                 Everyones entitled to MY opinion        ____        goldbergoasysdtnavymil Imagination is more important than knowledge  Albert Einstein            32   I live in Idaho  When I was 26 many years ago 10 years I bought a Trans Am new  Insurance was about 1300year  When I turned 26 it immediately dropped to 460year  I had not had any accidents before or after this was strictly an age change  That same rate stayed pretty much the same until I sold the car 2 years ago  My F150 pickup is about 80year less   The real amazing thing is that when I woke up at age 25 I felt SO MUCH MORE RESPONSIBLE than I was before     Wes    21     For your information California Male single under 25

Unless you are under 20 or have been driving for less than 5 years I think you are being seriously ripped off  I dont have one of the performance cars you listed but if your record is clean then you should not be paying over 2K   Did you try calling all the insurance dealers you could find Although rates are supposed to be standardized Ive found that most places I initially call give me some ridiculously high quote and finaly I hit one that is much lower   Also I have changed insurance companies when the rate went up at renewal no accidents tickets car gets older to maintain a low rate  You always have to be careful when it comes to insurance companies 8,"{

Actually fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual  boilingwater reactor nuclear plants  Theres a gripe in the industry that nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology  So its more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system as cold as possible  Hence big cooling towers           Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers but they usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water not most of the way down to ambient  Some plants do cool the condensers with water rather than air as one Canadian official asked about thermal  pollution deicing a river said Up here we view heat as a resource           Everybody runs closedcycle boilers  The water used is  purified of solids which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when the water boils  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than  cooling it so the boiler water is recycled,"{

Yes  I am adamantly an environmentalist  I will not use styrofoam table service Please keep that in mind as you read this post  I do not wish to attack environmentalism  A half truth is at least as dangerous as a complete lie  A complete lie will rarely be readily accepted while a half truth the lie subtly hidden is more powerfully offered by one who masquerades as an angel of light  Satan has for some people loosened the grip on treating the earth as something other than Gods intricate handiwork something other than that on which the health of future generations is based  It is being treated with respect  You think hes going to happily leave it at that  No  When one error is rejected it is his style to push people to the opposite error  Therefore the earth is not Gods intricate handiwork not because it is rubbish but because it is God  Mother earth is the one you are to primarily love and serve  I see two facets of a response to it  1 Care for the environment  Treat it with proper respect both because it is    Gods intricate handiwork and the health of future generation and because    showing the facet of one who is disregardful of such things does not    constitute what the Apostle Paul called becoming all things to all men so    that by all possible means I might save some     Dont say Forget the environment Ive got important things to spend my time    on  putting your foot in your mouth in this manner will destroy your    credibility in expressing the things that _are_ more important  2 Show that it is not the ultimate entity that it is creature and not    creator  Show that its beauty and glory points to a greater beauty and    glory  Show that it is not the ultimate tapestry but one of many cords    woven in the infinite tapestry,"{

The front covers should be available from Sony  Check with a local car stereo shop  You will probably definitely have to provide the units  serial number and hopefully you had registered the warranty card  I  dont know the cost but replacements have to be available to people who damage the face cover so it stands to reason that it can be replaced  As to deterring theft  When I worked for a stereo shop we referred the customer to a Sony 800 number  We would not sell the face nor did we have them available  Most people who came in asking for the face cover or a pullout sleave for that matter would look very disheartened to find that they acquired a deck they couldnt use  If theft occurs with these decks notify Sony  Serial numbers do catch theives,"{

My 14yo son has the usual teenage spotty chin and greasy nose  I bought him Clearasil face wash and ointment  I think that is probably enough along with the usual good diet  However he is on at me to get some product called Dalacin T which used to be a doctorsprescription only treatment but is not available over the chemists counter  I have asked a couple of pharmacists who say either his acne is not severe enough for Dalacin T or that Clearasil is OK  I had the odd spots as a teenager nothing serious  His father was the same so I dont figure his acne is going to escalate into something disfiguring  But I know kids are senstitive about their appearance  I am wary because a neighbours son had this wierd malady that was eventually put down to an overdose of vitamin A from acne treatment  I want to help  but with appropriate treatment  My son also has some scaliness around the hairline on his scalp  Sort of teenage cradle cap  Any pointersadvice on this  We have tried a couple of anti dandruff shampoos and some of these are inclined to make the condition worse not better  Shall I bury the kid till hes 21,"{

How do you define war  Do seiges and constant attacks on villiages count as acts of war or is that only when the Jews do them January 1948 Arab Liberation Army attacks Kfar Szold                1000 men attack Kfar Etzion 14 miles south of Jerusalem                     after cutting off the supply lines to it Attacks on Yehiam Western Galilee and kibbutz Tirat Tzvi By MidMarch The Jewish settlements in the Negev had been cut off from       land links with the rest of the Jewish population          The Etzion group of villiages near Hebron had been cut off             while 42 members of a convoy trying to supply Yehiam were             slaughtered cutting off the villiage Jerusalem was under seige being cut off from its supply route from      Tel Aviv the bombed out supply trucks have been left on the side      of that road to this day in memoriam  By this time 1200 Jews       had been killed  Of course this isnt war since its only the Arabs attacking Just like last week when the Fatah launched Katyusha rockets against Northern israel  Where does uprising end and war begin Will it still be Intifadah when the PLO brings in tanks,"{

I agree with this assessment  Furthermore its promotion as providing greater protection than bare voice is quite true as far as it goes  However the only way for it to fulfill its stated goal of letting LE wiretap terrorists and drug dealers is to restrict stronger techniques    Wiretap targets presently use strong encryption weak encryption or the vast majority no encryption  The latter two classes can be tapped  With weak encryption in every phone the noencryption class is merged into the weakencryption class  Will the introduction of Clipper cause targets presently enjoying strong privacy to give up on it  that is to rely for privacy on a system expressly designed to deny it to people like them  I doubt it  The mere introduction of this scheme will give the government nothing  The stated goal of preventing the degradation of wiretapping capabilities can be fulfilled by restriction of domestic cryptography and only by this restriction  Clipper appears to be no more than a sop given to the public to mute any complaints  We would find this a grossly inadequate tradeoff but I fear the public at large will not care  I hate to even mention gun control but most people seem to think that an assault weapon as the NYT uses the word is some sort of automatic weapon 50 caliber maybe  Who wants to have such a thing legal  Well people know even less about cryptology I suspect that strong cryptography could easily be labeled too much secrecy for lawabiding citizens to need   What they say is opinion but what they do is what matters and will continue unless overturned  And the courts are reluctant to annul law or regulation going to some length to decide cases on other grounds  Furthermore Congress can get away with quite a bit  They could levy a burdensome tax this would place enforcement in the hands of the BATF who as weve seen you really dont want on your case  They could invoke the Commerce Clause this seems most likely  This clause will get you anywhere these days  The 18th was required because the Supreme Court ruled a prohibitory statute unconstitutional  In 1970 Congress prohibited many drugs with a textual nod to the Commerce Clause  The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 still stands  I think the government could get away with it,"{

iftccutalkpoliticsguns  vincentcadgatechedu Vincent Fox  1034 am  Apr 14 1993   This isnt recguns so maybe this is getting a bet technical but I cant resist   Sometimes  Depends on WHY it misfired   I cant imagine doing much combat type shooting single action   Assuming the cylinder WILL rotate   Never hurts to err on the side of safety but if youve got one of those new fangled hammer blocks or transfer bar safeties its unnecessarily redundant  Id rather have the extra round   Quite true  Speed loaders are a little less convenient to pack around than magazines though   True but this is a training function   Cocked and locked for single actions or hammer down on double actions are the only carry modes that make sense  The 80 series Colts for example are quite safe to carry this way   Agreed  Now that Ive shot off my mouth a bit let me back some of this up  It is true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesnt cost you much  On the other hand Ive had all sorts of interesting things happen over the years  For example Ive had FACTORY ammunition that has had high primers  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds to minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem An auto  Jack the slide and continue  Ive had bullets come out of the case keeping the cylinder from turning see clearing paragraph above  About the WORST that can happen with a semi auto is a double feed  This can be cleared in seconds  Most revolvers are more fragile then semi autos  There are all sorts of close tolerance parts and fitting involved  Dropping the gun or a blow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action  Many of the problems that can be cured on the spot with a quality semi auto take a gun smith for a revolver  In short a revolver MAY be less likely to malfunction but as a rule when it does youre out of the fight The majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall into that category  Vincint makes many good points in this post but leaves off the opposing view of most of them  A real good starting place is Ayoobs The Semi Auto Pistol for Police and Self Defense  In general Id agree the revolver is an excellent first gun and self defense weapon for somebody that does not have the time and inclination that is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi auto effectively as a self defense arm  Most cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms  If the department isnt going to train them they arent going to take the time on their own  There is no doubt that training is an issue  The amount of training required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several times that of a revolver  Many cops dont bother  For myself Id hate to be limited to one or the other  Id rather pick what fits better with my personal inclination what Im wearing that day and so on  Like the Moderator on recguns says buy em all  That said I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of buying their first defense arm is right after taking a class get a Ruger or Smith revolver  Sorry Colt fans  Colt revolvers are ok too  If this post had gone the other way Id be arguing for revolvers,"{

Ted youre missing a vital point  As Roger Lustig pointed out in a previous response the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was because she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on a constant basis  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices  Bonilla on the other hand was found to have mentioned this one word a single time  If he had been known to go around criticizing homosexuals it would be a different story  Furthermore he is merely an athlete  He doesnt have to hire anyone as Schott had to do  Dave Pallone the former NL umpire who is an admitted homosexual has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets game at Shea  He like you thinks that Bonilla should be suspended from baseball  Pallone is hoping for a years suspension  In my opinion thats downright ludicrous  As Howie Rose on WFAN said if you start suspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time under whatever conditions then youd probably have enough people remaining to play a threeonthree game  Now honestly if you truly analyze the differences between the two cases that you bring up in your article I would think that youd reconsider your thoughts                                       Sean,"{

For the second straight game California scored a ton of late runs to crush the Brewhas It was six runs in the 8th for a 125 win Monday and five in the 8th and six in the 9th for a 122 win yesterday Jamie Navarro pitched seven strong innings but Orosco Austin Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part in the mockery of a bullpen yesterday Hows this for numbers Maldanado has pitched three scoreless innings and Navarros ERA is 075 The next lowest on the staff is Wegman at 514 Ouch  It doesnt look much better for the hitters Hamilton is batting 481 while Thon is hitting 458 and has seven RBI The next highest is three The next best hitter is Jaha at 267 and then Vaughn who has the teams only HR at 238 Another ouch Looking at the stats its not hard to see why the team is 25 In fact 25 doesnt sound bad when youre averaging three runsgame and giving up 66game   Still its early and things will undoubtedly get better The offense should come around but the bullpen is a major worry Fetters Plesac and Austin gave the Brewers great middle relief last year Lloyd Maldanado Manzanillo  Fetters Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be successful Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either held small leads or kept small deficits in place The starters will be okay the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around but the bullpen is a big question mark  In other news Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday while William Suero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal Todays game with California was cancelled,"{

In any case I think Viola would have made a better signing  Why  Viola is younger and is left handed how many left handed starters does  Toronto have  Well I agree that Viola is a better signing  However why does everyone say that you want lefthanded starters  I understand lefthanded spot relievers even though they usually face more righthanded batters than lefthanded batters  I just dont understand why people insist on lefthanded starters unless there is a park effect eg Yankee Stadium Most batters in MLB are righthanded so righthanded starters will have the platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters I guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams may be more vulnerable to LHPs than RHPs  However this is probably only a factor in the postseason because teams seldom juggle their starters for this reason during the regular season  I think you just want the best starters you can get regardless of whether they are lefties or righties  Lefthanded starters tend to have higher ERAs than righthanded starters precisely because managers go out of their way to start inferior lefties or perhaps because of the platoon advantage  Am I missing something here,"{

I have been following this thread on talkreligion socreligionchristianbiblestudy and here with interest  I am amazed at the different nonbiblical argument those who oppose the Sabbath present   One question comes to mind especially since my last one was not answered from Scripture  Maybe clh may wish to provide the first response  There is a lot of talk about the Sabbath of the TC being ceremonial  Answer this  Since the TC commandments is one law with ten parts on what biblical basis have you decided that only the Sabbath portion is ceremonial OR You say that the seventhday is the Sabbath but not applicable to Gentile Christians  Does that mean the Sabbath commandment has been annulled  References please  If God did not intend His requirements on the Jews to be applicable to Gentile Christians why did He make it plain that the Gentiles were now grafted into the commonwealth of Israel  Darius,"{

an excellent automatic can be found in the subaru legacy  it switches to sport mode when the electronics figure it  not when the driver sets the switch which is the proper way to do it IMO  so what does sport mode entail  several things  1 revving to red line or to the rev limiter in the case of the legacy  2 delayed upshifts  ie if you lift off briefly it will remain in the 	low gear  this is handy if you are charging through corners and 	would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when theres 	another curve approaching  3 part throttle downshifts based on the speed at which the pedal is 	depressed rather than the position of the pedal  modern 	electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode 	this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about 	to turn red  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as 	little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough  also i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage than a dumb driver with a stick all else being equal remember that the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to use for each situation how many times have you ridden with an inattentive driver cruising on the highway at 5565 in 4th gear of a 5 speed    how many  of people who drive manuals really know what the best gear to use is for every conceivable situation  im sure there will be some who know but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with all possible scenarioratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do better  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout high gear low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear high revs and small throttle opening  the explanation is quite simple if one sits down to think about it but not that obvious at first sight,"{

Equipped with largearea widewavelength 120     Angstrom Xray telescope Xray CCD cameras and imaging gas     scintillation proportional counters       CASSINI  Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe Cassini is a joint     NASAESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian     system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe Cassini     is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IVCentaur in October of 1997     After gravity assists of Venus Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA     trajectory the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004 Upon     arrival the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an     orbit around Saturn Near the end of this initial orbit the Huygens     Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of     Titan The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours     while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the     surface After the completion of the Probe mission the Orbiter     continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years Titan     synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and     targeted flybys of Iapetus Dione and Enceladus The objectives of the     mission are threefold conduct detailed studies of Saturns atmosphere     rings and magnetosphere conduct closeup studies of Saturns     satellites and characterize Titans atmosphere and surface      One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its     surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that     result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere These     hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain     down onto the surface The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to     peer through Titans clouds and determine if there is liquid on the     surface Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will     investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere      The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini 16251712 the     first director of the Paris Observatory who discovered several of     Saturns satellites and the major division in its rings The Titan     atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan     Huygens 16291695 who discovered Titan and first described the true     nature of Saturns rings  	 Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission VVEJGA Trajectory 	  	   100697  Titan IVCentaur Launch 	   042198  Venus 1 Gravity Assist 	   062099  Venus 2 Gravity Assist

 experiments such as magnetometer ion and electron collectors for     various energy ranges plasma wave radio receivers etc but no camera      Since no humanbuilt rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of     the ecliptic plane it went to Jupiter instead and stole energy from     that planet by sliding over Jupiters north pole in a gravityassist     manuver in February 1992 This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted     about 85 degrees to the ecliptic It will pass over the Suns south pole     in the summer of 1993 Its aphelion is 52 AU and surprisingly its     perihelion is about 15 AU thats right a solarstudies spacecraft     thats always further from the Sun than the Earth is      While in Jupiters neigborhood Ulysses studied the magnetic and     radiation environment

d d I just thought of another one in the Bible so its definately not because of lack of religion  The Book of Esther which I read the other day for other reasons describes the origin of Purim a Jewish celbration of joy and peace  The long and short of the story is that 75000 people were killed when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions  lying about you couldnt swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice peaceful solution  Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to mind  I agree with Bobby this far religion as it is used to kill large numbers of people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally intended for  That doesnt reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion it is just a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in the Universe  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in religious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war  Many people have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own stomachecontentsthan in any absolute truth and have therefore been driven to kill by their leaders  The point is that there are many things involved in religion that often lead to war  Whether these things are a part of religion an unpleasant side effect or as Bobby would have it the result of people switching between Religion and Atheism spontaneously the results are the same    Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest parts of Mans history  Atheists on the other hand preenpreen are typically not an ideological social caste nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs The overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is  Two groups with very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to further their means  Anyone who cannot see the obvious  namely that these were groups founded for reasons entirely their own who used religious persecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more powerfull  is trying too hard  Basically Bobby uses these examples because there are so few wars that were not specifically fought over religion that he does not have many choices  Well Im off to Key West where the only flames are heating the bottom of little silver butterdishes  ciao,"{

Pardon me Here is to an amherstclown    Your three chiefs Dro Hamazasp and Kulkhandanian are the ringleaders   of the bands which have destroyed Tartar villages and have staged    massacres in Zangezour Surmali Etchmiadzin and Zangibasar This is   intolerable   Were you expecting a different response Here is another one  Source K S Papazian Patriotism Perverted Baikar Press Boston 1934          73 pages with Appendix  p 25 third paragraph  Some real fighters sprang up from among the people who struck terror  into the hearts of the Turks   Within a few months after the war began these Armenian guerrilla  forces operating in close coordination with the Russians were  savagely attacking Turkish cities towns and villages in the east  massacring their inhabitants without mercy while at the same time  working to sabotage the Ottoman armys war effort by destroying roads  and bridges raiding caravans and doing whatever else they could to  ease Russian occupation The atrocities committed by the Armenian   volunteer forces accompanying the Russian army were so severe that the   Russian commanders themselves were compelled to withdraw them from the   fighting fronts and sent them to rear guard duties The memoirs of many  Russian officers who served in the east at this time are filled with   accounts of the revolting atrocities committed by these Armenian   guerrillas which were savage even by relatively primitive standards of  war then observed in such areas1  1 Journal de Guerre du Deuxieme dArtillerie de Forteresse Russe       dErzeroum 1919 p 28   honored me by reproducing my text  Unfortunately he has still not produced  the documents on Jews in LATVIA  Instead he asks for my views on the  Turkish Genocide  Well that debate seems to be going on in a few hundred  other threads  Ill let other people bring the usual charges try to debunk  MutluArgicCosar a netwide Terrorism Triangle and their spurious evidence    When that does ever happen look out the window to see if there is a  nonfascist xSoviet Armenian Government in the East Now where is  your nonexistent list of scholars What a moronian During the First   World War and the ensuing years  19141920 the Armenian Dictatorship   through a premeditated and systematic genocide tried to complete its   centuriesold policy of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by   savagely murdering 25 million Muslims and deporting the rest from   their 1000 year homeland   How could you Because there is none   Like conversing with a brick wall And you are not responding to what I  am writing By the way that bullshit is justly regarded as the first  instance of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people For nearly one thousand years the Turkish and Kurdish people lived  on their homeland  the last one hundred under the oppressive Soviet  and Armenian occupation The persecutions culminated in 1914 The  Armenian Government planned and carried out a Genocide against its  Muslim subjects 25 million Turks and Kurds were murdered and the  remainder driven out of their homeland After one thousand years  Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks and Kurds   The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye  Today xSoviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and  Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by xSoviet Armenia  Today xSoviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its  predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against  humanity  xSoviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims  by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds   You may assert whatever you wish   Ditto   The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance  of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people  This event is incontrovertibly proven by historians government  and international political leaders such as US Ambassador Mark   Bristol    And still anxiously awaiting   so the list goes on and on and on    Im still trying to find out about those Jews in LATVIA  Can you post those   documents PLEEEEEEEASE Mr Argic  Puhleeze could you  Cmon its my  birthday in three weeks post them for me as a birthday present    Remember the issue at hand is the coldblooded genocide of 25 million   Muslim people by the Armenians between 19141920 and the ArmenianNazi   collaboration during World War II Anything to add   Remember the issue at hand is the ArmenianNazi collaboration during  World War II and the Turkish Genocide And I still fail to see how you can challenge the following western sources  Source John Dewey The New Republic Vol 40 Nov 12 1928 pp 2689  Happy the minority Jews which has had no Christian nation to protect it  And one recalls that the Jews took up their abode in fanatic Turkey  when they were expelled from Europe especially Spain by Saintly Christians  and they have lived here for centuries in at least as much tranquility and  liberty as their fellow Turkish subjects all being exposed alike to the  rapacity of their common rulers To one brought up as most Americans have   been in the Gladstonian and foreignmissionary tradition the condition of   the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious  differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they  were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every   nation in the world would have treated as treasonable One readily   reaches the conclusion that the Jews in Turkey were fortunate   He also stated that  they Armenians traitorously turned Turkish cities over to the Russian   invader that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and  fifty thousand men to fight a civil war and that they burned at least  a hundred Turkish villages and exterminated their population   I want the documents of Jews in Latvia  I think several other  people on socculturegreek are already disputing with you about the Turkish  Genocide    Is this the joke of the month Who when how where What a clown   How about Prof Shaw a Jewish scholar  Source Stanford J Shaw on Armenian collaboration with invading Russian armies in 1914 History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey Volume II Reform Revolution  Republic The Rise of Modern Turkey 18081975 London Cambridge University Press 1977 pp 315316  In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city   of Van whose 33789 Armenians comprised 423 percent of the population   closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the EmpireLeaving Erivan   on April 28 1915 Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized   and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during   the next two days while the small Ottoman garrison had to retreat to the  southern side of the lake  Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions  Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims  Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First  World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse  to serve their state the Ottoman Empire and to assist instead other  invading Russian armies Their hope was their participation in the Russian  success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of  Ottoman territories Armenian political leaders army officers and common  soldiers began deserting in droves  With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of  World War I the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottomans enemy  increased drastically Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks  Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations who in turn  massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of  expected arrival of the invading Russian armies  Source Stanford J Shaw History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey         Vol II

president of the Armenian National Bureau in Tiflis declaring in response   From all countries Armenians are hurrying to enter the ranks of the    glorious Russian Army with their blood to serve the victory of Russian   armsLet the Russian flag wave freely over the Dardanelles and the   Bosporus Let with Your will great Majesty the peoples remaining   under the Turkish yoke receive freedom Let

about   the ArmenianNazi colaboration during World War II Any comment   It could be perhaps your head wasnt screwed on just right In 1941  while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration  camps the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian  battalion to fight alongside the Nazis In 1943 this battalion had  grown into eight battalions of 20000strong under the command of the former guerilla leader Dro the butcher who was the former dictator of the shortlived Armenian Dictatorship 19181920 and the architect of the  coldblooded genocide of 25 million Turks and Kurds between 19141920 An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party  leaders in Berlin which was recognized by the Nazis Encouraged by  this the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed  and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the  members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitlers policy of  extermination of the Jews  This ArmenianNazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an encore performance staged by the Armenians during WWI when they backstabbed and exterminated 25 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army  Furthermore as McCarthy put it the Armenian dictatorship was granted a respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros Armistice with the Allies October 30 1918 The Allies had decided to create a Greater Armenia including the old Russian province of Yerevan and adjoining areas as well as most parts of Anatolia claimed by the Armenian fanatics Only the area called Cilicia around the Ottoman province of Adana was to be excluded as it had already been claimed by the French The Allies quickly set about attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks who could be expected to oppose their plans   On April 19 1919 the British Army occupied Kars gave civilian and military power over to the Armenians then withdrew The British planned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship even  though the Russian prewar census had shown Kars Province to be over 60 Muslim The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed but the  British could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains The fate of the Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier in Eastern Anatolia Murder pillage genocide and the destruction of Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of Kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded by remaining units of the Ottoman Army The British had left  the scene to the Armenian genocide squads Therefore few  Europeans were present to observe the genocide One British soldier Colonel Rawlinson who was assigned to supervise the disarmament of Otoman soldiers saw what was occurring   Rawlinson wired to his superiors   in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in  independent command of the Moslim population as their troops   being without discipline and not being under effective control  atrocities were constantly being committed    Come again   These European Dashnags with headquarters in Berlin appealed to  Why   No

cities of Erzincan and Erzurum which we have   recently taken over is given below   These two beautiful cities of our country which are alike in the  calamities and destruction which they suffered have been destroyed  as the specially designed and built public and private buildings of  these cities were deliberately burnt by Armenians apart from the   destruction suffered during the twoyear Russian occupation   All barracks buildings of Erzincan the cavalry barracks in Erzurum  the Government building and Army Corps Headquarters are among those  burnt In short both cities are burnt destroyed and trees cut down   As to the people of these cities   All people old enough to use weapons rounded up taken to the Sarikamis  direction for road building and were slaughtered The remaining people  were subject to cruelties and murder by Armenians following the   withdrawal of Russians and were partly annihilated the corpses thrown   into wells burnt in houses mutilated by bayonets their abdomens  ripped open in slaughterhouses their lungs and livers torn out girls  and women hung up by their hair after all kinds of devilish acts  The few people who were able to survive these cruelties worse than  those of the Spanish Inquisition are in poverty more dead than alive  horrified some driven insane about 1500 in Erzincan and 30000 in  Erzurum The people are hungry and in poverty for whatever they had  has been taken away from them their lands left uncultivated   The people have just been able to exist with some provisions found in  stores left over from the Russians The villages round Erzincan and   Erzurum are in the worst condition Some villages on the road have   been leveled to the ground leaving no stone the people completely  massacred   Let me submit to your information with deep grief and regret that  history has never before witnessed cruelties at such dimensions    a long list   a long list  And still anxiously awaiting  Serdar Argic,"{

Now theres a good idea  All you need is 20 amps DC for a few minutes and a good wetware memory was I using wp or autocad or  I thought of the same idea myself a few days ago Ive got a fairly new car battery that I take along in my 4x4 when I go camping and it sits around useless when Im home I wish I could get a batteryless ups to use it with or use it with a heavy duty 5volt regulator to supply the PC But I guess youd need 5v and 12v  and 12 too 2 more batteries   An alternative would be to leave a 40 AMP battery charger hooked up to the battery and run a 12vdc to 110vac converter running all the time and when the power goes out voila  the 110vac converter keeps on running off the battery  and then I could take the 110vac converter and my computer on the camping trips,"{

Okay lets suppose that the NSANISTMykotronix Registered Key system becomes standard and Im able to buy such a system from my local radio shack Every phone comes with a built in chip and the government has the key to every phone call  I go and buy a phone and dutifully register the key   Whats to prevent me from swapping phones with a friend or  buying a used phone at a garage sale Whooa The secret registered keys just became unsynchronized When the government comes  to listen in they only receive gobbledlygook because the  secret key registered under my name isnt the right one   That leads me to conjecture that  1 The system isnt that secure There are just two master keys that work for all the phones in the country The part about registering your keys is just bogus   or   2 The system is vulnerable to simple phone swapping attacks like this Criminals will quickly figure this out and go to town,"{

I have a 1986 Acura Integra 5 speed with 95000 miles on it It is positively the worst car I have ever owned I had an 83 Prelude that had 160k miles on it when I sold it and it was still going strong   This is with religious attention to maintenance such as oil changes etc Both cars were driven in exactly the same manner    1 It has gone through two clutches which are underrated   2 3 sets of tires really eats tires in the front even with careful align   3 All struts started leaking about 2530k miles   4 Windshield wiper motor burned up service note on this one   5 Seek stop working on radio about 20k miles   6 Two timing belts   7 Constant error signals from computer    8 And finally A rod bearing went out on the No 1 piston seriously damaging      the crankshaft contaminating the engine etc When the overhaul was done      last week it required new crankshaft one new cam shaft has two because      the camshaft shattered when they tried to mill it The camshaft took 4      weeks to get because it is on national back order        Everything on the engine is unique to the 1986 year They went to a new      design in 87 Parts are very expensive,"{

Yes this is also my understanding of the majority of Islamic laws However I believe there are also certain legal rulings which in all five schools of law 4 sunni and 1 jaffari can be levelled against muslim or nonmuslims both within and outside daralislam I do not know if apostasy when accompanied by active persistent and open hostility to Islam falls into this category of the law I do know that historically apostasy has very rarely been punished at all let alone by the death penalty  My understanding is that Khomeinis ruling was not based on the law of apostasy alone It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no precedent in the Quran hadith or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly levelling death penalties for apostasy  I believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of fasad This ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an Islamic state and it can be carried out by individuals The reward was not offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran   I would concur that the thrust of the fatwa from what I remember was levelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication of the book However the charge of fasad can encompass a number of lesser charges I remember that when diplomatic relations broke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa  Iran stressed that the condemnation of the author and the removal of the book from circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the crisis But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not the main thrust behind the fatwa Islamic charges such as fasad are levelled at people not books  The Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the issuance of the fatwa Rushdie went on a media blitz presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people crazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred  Fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost his image and push the book he was everywhere in the media Then Muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while protesting against the book Rushdie appeared momentarily concerned then climbed back on his media horse to once again attack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights It was at this point that the fatwa on fasad was issued  The fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie  any actions of Rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of the ruling The book remains in circulation not by some independant will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers The fatwa against the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well The crime was certainly a crime in progress at many levels and was being played out and played up in the the full view of the media,"{

assuming yours is a non turbo MR2 the gruffness is characteristic of a large inline 4 that doesnt have balance shafts  i guess toyota didnt care about little details like that when they can brag about the mid engine configuration and the flashy styling  myself i automatically cross out any car from consideration or recommendation which has an inline 4 larger than 2 liters and no balance shafts  it is a good rule of thumb to keep in mind if you ever want a halfway decent engine    if the noise really bugs you there is nothing else that you can do except to sell it and get a V6,"{

However also be aware that Implementors notes are basicly recommendations they are NOT part of the spec  As others have noted many vendors including SGI violate this  Indeed the main point is to reduce impedance changes and therefore reflections and therefore noise on the bus,"{

I think you may be chasing the wrong problem  I dont think it is the function overloading at all I do that sort of thing all of the time in BC without a hitch  The big problems I have encountered in porting MFC to BC is that fact that MFC _depends_ on a couple of invalid C assumptions  I have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under BC but the reason is that MS makes some bad assumptions about the order in which staticglobal objects are initialized ie some objects are getting accessed before they are initialized  The problem is in the ownerdraw menu code somewhere if you comment out that section all other pieces of ctrltest work fine  Two other major gotchas I have found using MFC under BC   The CFileOpenFlags enum uses hardcoded numbers for the open mode   rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrlh which differ   between MSC and BC   All of the MFC collection classes depend on another bad C   assumption that a reference to a base object can used be in place   of a reference to a derived object true for pointers NOT for   references  I am sure there are other problems along the same lines but I have not encountered them yet  I have not seen MFC 20 yet but I hope that some of these will be addressed  If they are not all of MSs hype about portability to other vendors compilers will be just that,"{

Hi Noel  Ive made some attempts to write a converter that reads Adobe Type 1 fonts triangulates them bevelizes them and extrudes them to result in a generic 3d object which could be used with PoV fi  The problem Im currently stuck on is that theres no algorithm which triangulates any arbitrary polygonal shape Delaunay seems to be limited to convex hulls Constrained delaunay may be okay but I have no code example of how to do it  Another way to do the bartman may be   TGA2POV  A selfmade variation of this using heightfields    Create a bw picture BIG of the text you need fi using a PostScript   previewer Then use this as a heightfield If it is white on black   the heightfield is exactly the images white parts its still open   on the backside To close it mirror it and compound it with the original  Example  object     union        height_field  gif abp2gif        height_field  gif abp2gif scale 1 1 1        texture        Glass        translate 05 0 05      center    rotate 90 0 0              rotate upwards    scale  10 5 100             scale bigger and thicker    translate 0 2 0             final placement    abp2gif is a GIF of arbitrary size containing ABP black on white in TimesRoman 256 points,"{

Is this a figment of your imagination Here is another one    Source Mitteilungsblatt Berlin December 1939 Nr 2 and 56   Yet another historical fact a fact that for years has been deliberately   forgotten concealed and wiped from memory  the fact of ArmenianNazi   collaboration   A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der DeutschArmenischen Gesselschaft  is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration The   magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany  and continued publication until the end of 1944 Even the name of the  magazine which implies a declaration of ArmenianNazi cooperation  is attentiongetting   This magazine every issue of which proves the collaboration is historically  important as documentary evidence It is a heap of writing that should be  an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind    In Nazi Germany Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain  political economic and social rights were thus granted to them They   occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices  The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered   Aryan and what befell them   Serdar Argic,"{

Not hard you can do the refreshing and access cycles by software but this hogs most of the available CPU cycles on a lowend controller Ive seen some application note from Philips that used one of their 8051 derivatives as a printer buffer with up to 1MB of dynamic ram that was accessed and refreshed with software bitbanging  Another alternative would be to use one of those nice DRAM controller chips that create static RAM appearance and all that but they may be too expensive to make it worthwhile,"{

As the subjects says Windows 31 keeps crashing givinh me GPF on me of   late  It was never a very stable package but now it seems to crash every   day  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently ie I   cant reproduce crashes and they are not always GPFs in the same   application Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application   that caused an error but other times windows acts very strange and I   need to reboot  Some background  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS  When I   first got it it had 4Mg of memory  It ran windows fine not too many   GPFs  Then a couple of weekends ago I installed Lotus 123 for windows   with ATM a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS  The Leading edge   machine is kind of strange in that it has the IDE controler built into   the motherboard the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into   the motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS Apparently I   was told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother   board  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from   SAMSUNG and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS They are recognized   fine by the BIOS RAM check The game card is a generic 20 gamecard  The reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes   rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctlaltdel still leaves   the machine kind of flaky but turning it on and off doesnt   I havent tried taking out the RAM or the game card because as I said   these GPF are not reproducible at will  I have gone through and entire   day using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPFs   in the sppace of 20 minutes  What can I do  This situation is most annoying Are there any good   diagnostic tools for hardware Do you think that this might be a software   problem ie EMM386 etc If it helps i have manage to get GPFs on After   Dark quicken Paint shop pro A lot of them have been in userexe or   gdiexe  Any help is truly appreciated  Eric,"{

Here is a press release from the Reserve Officers Association   Reserve Officers Say Demographics Ignored in Nominations to Close Naval Marine Reserve Centers  To National Desk Defense Writer  Contact Herbert M Hart of the Reserve Officers Association of           the United States 2024792258     WASHINGTON April 13 US Newswire  The Reserve Officers Association of the United States has alerted the Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission that the services failed to give sufficient weight to demographics in recommendations made to close 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve centers    In letters to the closure commission and to all 86 members of Congress with affected locations in their constituencies including Sen Sam Nunn DGa chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee ROA charged that the developers of the NavyMarine list ignored demographics of the civilian population particularly prior service personnel    ROAs executive director Maj Gen Evan L Hultman AUS Ret suggested concern that the only plausible alternative is that they are intentionally attempting to foreclose the Naval Reserve components from maintaining even todays relatively low level of participation in their parent services Total Force of the future    He asked the commission to remove from consideration all locations without sufficient and convincing demographic data to warrant approval of the requested action    Only a few of the 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve installations on this list are large enough to have a significant impact on the community if closed wrote Hultman  The major issue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a large percentage of the existing locations    Hultman reminded the commission The fact that the vast majority of the Reserve installations on this list do not come close to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in this process certainly supports the thesis that these actions are simply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the Navy and Marine Corps Reserve    ROA also noted that at the end of the 1960s when the number of Naval Reservists was approximately the same as today there were 480 Naval Reserve facilities  If the Navy recommendations are approved there will be less than 200 Naval Reserve facilities    Facilities on the list include seven Naval Air Stations ranging from South Weymouth Mass to Alameda Calif 28 Naval Reserve Centers in Macon Ga and Parkersburg WVa to Missoula and Great Falls Mont  NavalMarine Corps Reserve Centers include four in San Francisco Fort Wayne Ind Billings Mont and Abilene Texas    A major Marine Reserve Center on the list is that at El Toro Calif plus six others  30,"{

deleted  In plain Motify using a dialog inline like this simply isnt done You need to set callbacks from the buttonswidgets in your dialog and let the callback routines do the work In the callbacks you can then carry on the flow of logic   XView from Sun actually supports this very neatly with a Notify box which can return a status inline it does actualy ease coding but goes against the event driven style of an application  Summary Redesign required,"{
